🌐 Humaira's Tech Portfolio

Hi, I'm Humaira — a passionate UI/UX designer and front-end developer who builds beautiful, accessible, and user-friendly web applications. This portfolio is a curated showcase of my skills, creative process, and the projects I've worked on.
✨ About This Portfolio

This portfolio was built from scratch using modern front-end tools and design practices. I followed a design-first approach, beginning with wireframes and user flows in Figma, before diving into development using:

    React (component-based architecture)

    Tailwind CSS (for utility-first styling)

    Vite (for fast development builds)

    JavaScript & TypeScript

    Custom scroll animations and interaction logic using IntersectionObserver

🧠 Design Process

    Research & Planning

        Defined target audience: recruiters, clients, and collaborators.

        Outlined key sections: Home, About, Projects, Contact.

    Wireframing & Prototyping

        Used Figma to build mobile-first wireframes.

        Ensured usability with clear CTAs and visual hierarchy.

    UI Design

        Focused on a clean, minimal aesthetic.

        Leveraged glassmorphism and gradients for modern styling.

        Ensured color contrast and typography for accessibility.

    Development

        Modularized the project using reusable React components.

        Used Tailwind CSS for fast prototyping and responsiveness.

        Implemented RevealOnScroll animations for smooth transitions.

        Responsive design tested across desktop, tablet, and mobile.
